          From January 1 to May 1, 2024, I set out on a human-powered journey from my front door in Seattle. 
          I ran with a baby jogger holding my camping gear, food, and skis. 
          This adventure was inspired in large part by my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newsminer.com/man-runs-across-alaska-to-raise-money-for-wounded-warriors-project/article_4849277f-caae-5c9e-80b9-08aced58efbb.html">Matt Montavon</a> who ran 1,100 miles across Alaska with a stroller.

          <h1>Thank You!</h1>
          <p>To everyone who connected with me, shared their friendship, an adventure, or inspiration. I'm grateful for each and every interaction that gave me a boost and reminded me I wasn't alone.</p>

          <h4>Emergency Contacts</h4>
          <p>Mike Cassidy and Dan Royal were there to check in with me every single day of the adventure, even in the backcountry with via inReach. Having the consistency of being in contact with them through the most remote parts of the journey kept me sane. Cassidy has been a mentor ever since he took me for my first outdoor rock climb at summer camp when I was 12 years old. Dan has been a ski partner and mountaineering mentor since I moved to Seattle last year.</p>

          <h4>Family</h4>
          <p>My mom, Kathy Karp Cohen and my dad Andy Cohen are my biggest fans. My bffs Daniel and Lukas who love and accept me with my quirks. My grandparents Geega and Pop Pop from whom I get my cautious and thoughtful approach to adventure. My Uncle Jonny who has been a role model to me my whole life. My aunt Ronna for inspiring me to work hard and be rugged. My aunt Marci for inspiring me to keep my heart open and wander. My cousin Erica for her extreme unconditional love, cheering me on throughout the adventure. My cousin Dara for her extreme honesty and coining the phrase “Big Dumb Adventure”. Michael Kanner for showing me how to design my life as a work of art.</p>

          <h4>Seattle</h4>
          <p>Tiara, Tally, Anna, Erik, Julie — the world's greatest housemates who sent me off inflated with love. Isabella whose friendship I treasure. My friends in the Cowgill Trail Collective for motivating me to test my limits. Kayla and Michael who made me feel so welcome in my move to Seattle and sent me off on a high.</p>

          <h4>Mentors</h4>
          <p>
            Zach Anderson, the most unselfish mountain guide I've ever met, who joined me on the Mount Baker adventure leg. 
            Antoine who showed me how to be fearless in the backcountry. 
            Amanda and Matt Montovan for enabling backcountry adventures in Alaska over the last two summers that have been invaluable outdoor education. 
            Garr who told me if there's something in my heart I feel compelled to do, do it and do it fearlessly.
            Jess Shade who brought me on my first ever snow camping trip and taught me to do the hard thing. 
          </p>

          <h4>Direct Support</h4>
          <p>

            Pam and Eric Dolven who hosted me on both ends of my journey.
            Devin Groody who housed me through the cold snap and did not one but two photo shoots with me.

            Anthony Marra for hosting me in Bellingham and being one of the people who inspired this adventure after bikepacking with skis across the Pacific Northwest, Pakistan, and New Zealand. He enthusiastically shared his learnings from his multiple multi-monthlong, multi-sport human-powered adventures.
            Katie and Mark Hicks for hosting me in the delightful community of Birch Bay, in the  northwestern of the lower 48.
            Cormac Toler-Scott for welcoming me to Canada and being a damn good friend.

            Jean Sigrid Nelson for hosting me in Clearwater and becoming one of the biggest cheerleaders of my trip, her encouragement continues to lift me.
            The Onslow family— Grayson, Richard, Lee, Tom, Scout and, Snickers— for hosting me for a full week in Blue River as I recovered from fatigue and joint wear and tear. This extended time to recover became the turning point of the adventure, as it was the last time I took consecutive rest days for the remaining two months of the trip.
            Peggy and Tom who hosted me for two nights in Valemount in the house they built themselves and shared stories from their fascinating lives. 
            Brittany Andrews who hosted me in Jasper for three nights as I prepped for the Icefields Parkway and got me onto a free icewalk through Maligne Canyon.

        In 2011, Toby Tanser completed a “Sea to the Stars” run traveling from the Indian Ocean to the top of Kilimanjaro to raise money for the construction of the first children’s hospital in East Africa, 
        which opened its doors in 2015. At the time, Tanser lived in New York City where he was head coach of the NYC Nike Running Club and served on the board of directors for the NYC Marathon for 15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, almost ten years after the hospital opened, Toby's charity Shoe 4 Africa is building another hospital, the first Children's Cancer Hospital in East Africa! In order to raise money for the construction 
        of this hospital (currently 20% complete), I will follow in Toby's footsteps running to Kilimanjaro, and then I will continue running onwards to Eldoret, Kenya where Toby lives today.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal motivation to follow in Toby's footsteps comes from understanding his journey, how he carried the weight of such a grand mission to the top of Kilimanjaro, and 
        why he turned his back on New York City— the place I was born. I fly to Africa with my family on June 8 where we will go on a safari. When my family flies home, I will 
        stay and run from the coast to Eldoret.
