              In 2011, Toby Tanser completed his “Sea to the Stars” run from the Indian Ocean to the top of Kilimanjaro. His run raised over $100,000 for the construction of the Shoe 4 Africa hospital, East Africa's first and only public children’s hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by Toby, from June to October 2024, I ran over 1000 miles through East Africa and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.every.org/shoe4africa/f/running-to-the-man-who">raised over $10000 for Shoe 4 Africa</a>.
            <p>
              My run took me from the Tanzania coast to the top of Kilimanjaro to the Shoe 4 Africa Hospital itself and onwards to Uganda and Rwanda. The adventure also included fastest known times on Mt Meru, the fifth tallest mountain in Africa, and Ol Doinyo Lengai, the "Mountain of God".

            <h1>Thank You!</h1>
            <p>To everyone who connected with me, shared their friendship, an adventure, or inspiration. I'm grateful for each and every interaction that gave me a boost and reminded me I wasn't alone.</p>

            <h4>Emergency Contacts</h4>
            <p>Mike Cassidy and Dan Royal were there to check in with me every single day of the adventure, even in the backcountry with via inReach. Having the consistency of being in contact with them through the most remote parts of the journey kept me sane. Cassidy has been a mentor ever since he took me for my first outdoor rock climb at summer camp when I was 12 years old. Dan has been a ski partner and mountaineering mentor since I moved to Seattle last year.</p>

            <h4>Family</h4>
            <p>My mom, Kathy Karp Cohen and my dad Andy Cohen are my biggest fans. My bffs Daniel and Lukas who love and accept me with my quirks. My grandparents Geega and Pop Pop from whom I get my cautious and thoughtful approach to adventure. My Uncle Jonny who has been a role model to me my whole life. My aunt Ronna for inspiring me to work hard and be rugged. My aunt Marci for inspiring me to keep my heart open and wander. My cousin Erica for her extreme unconditional love, cheering me on throughout the adventure. My cousin Dara for her extreme honesty and coining the phrase “Big Dumb Adventure”. Michael Kanner for showing me how to design my life as a work of art.</p>

            <h4>Seattle</h4>
            <p>Tiara, Tally, Anna, Erik, Julie — the world's greatest housemates who sent me off inflated with love. Isabella whose friendship I treasure. My friends in the Cowgill Trail Collective for motivating me to test my limits. Kayla and Michael who made me feel so welcome in my move to Seattle and sent me off on a high.</p>

            <h4>Mentors</h4>
            <p>
              Zach Anderson, the most unselfish mountain guide I've ever met, who joined me on the Mount Baker adventure leg. 
              Antoine who showed me how to be fearless in the backcountry. 
              Amanda and Matt Montovan for enabling backcountry adventures in Alaska over the last two summers that have been invaluable outdoor education. 
              Garr who told me if there's something in my heart I feel compelled to do, do it and do it fearlessly.
              Jess Shade who brought me on my first ever snow camping trip and taught me to do the hard thing. 
            </p>

            <h4>Direct Support</h4>
            <p>
              JD and Glen Moore who sold me much of the gear that came on this adventure. 
              Pam and Eric Dolven who hosted me on both ends of my journey.
              Devin Groody who housed me through the cold snap and did not one but two photo shoots with me.
              Bob and Brenda from Upriver for inviting me to go skiing when they saw me hanging out at a gas station.
              Tom Clement and Meesh Alwine who hosted me at both ends of the adventure and made it clear I will always have a home in Marblemount.
              Conor Roland who became an instant friend on the Easton Glacier and understood the vision for the adventure before even I did.
              Calvin Lautsch who gave me a roof to sleep under, not knowing who I was, at a time when I truly needed it being cold, wet, and physically destroyed. 
              Anthony Marra for hosting me in Bellingham and being one of the people who inspired this adventure after bikepacking with skis across the Pacific Northwest, Pakistan, and New Zealand. He enthusiastically shared his learnings from his multiple multi-monthlong, multi-sport human-powered adventures.
              Katie and Mark Hicks for hosting me in the delightful community of Birch Bay, in the  northwestern of the lower 48.
              Cormac Toler-Scott for welcoming me to Canada and being a damn good friend. 
              Caitlyn Schneider and Julian for making me know I always have a home in Vancouver and sharing with me their wealth of knowledge about adventuring in the south coast mountains for Canada. 
              Larissa and Jon Wescott for hosting me in Lions Bay, enabling alternate sport adventures (hiking, whitewater rafting, bouldering), and staying invested in the adventure after I left.
              Lisa from Whistler Community Services who gave me two complimentary lift tickets to the ski resort.
              Sara Jennings who agreed to host me at the last minute in Whistler, enabling to use the free lift tickets.
              Vivian Yu Zhou and Bill Bateman for hosting me for two relaxing nights in Pemberton. 
              Collin and Rob for chatting with me on Pavllion Lake and giving me Kokanee salmon they caught ice fishing.
              Jen and Ivan for hosting me for two nights in Kamloops and cooking the finest meals of my entire adventure.
              Liam Waller for befriending me on the side of the highway in McLure and letting me camp on his land. 
              Jean Sigrid Nelson for hosting me in Clearwater and becoming one of the biggest cheerleaders of my trip, her encouragement continues to lift me.
              The Onslow family— Grayson, Richard, Lee, Tom, Scout and, Snickers— for hosting me for a full week in Blue River as I recovered from fatigue and joint wear and tear. This extended time to recover became the turning point of the adventure, as it was the last time I took consecutive rest days for the remaining two months of the trip.
